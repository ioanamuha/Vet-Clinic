# Vet Clinic Web Application

This project is a Spring-based web application designed for managing a veterinary clinic. The application follows object-oriented programming principles (OOP), including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, and uses CRUD operations to interact with the database.

## Features

1. User Registration: Allows new users to register within the system.
2. User Authentication: Provides secure login functionality.
3. Animal Categories Definition: Enables defining different categories of animals treated at the clinic.
4. Veterinarian Management: Allows adding and managing details about veterinarians.
5. Patient Records: Facilitates the registration of patients' records, including details such as age and weight.
6. Consultation Scheduling: Enables scheduling consultations for patients.
7. Prescription Management: Handles the issuance of prescriptions.
8. Technologies Used
- Java: Main programming language.
- Spring Framework: Used for building the web application, including Spring Boot for rapid development.
- Thymeleaf: Templating engine for rendering views.
- MySQL Database: Database management system used to store data.
- MySQL Workbench: Used for database modeling and management.
- JPA/Hibernate: For ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to manage database entities.
- Maven: Build and dependency management.
- HTML/CSS: For front-end development.
- Bootstrap: For responsive web design.

## Technical Details

- CRUD Operations: Each functionality involves creating an entity and its corresponding database table. Operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are implemented to ensure the correct behavior of the application.
- OOP Principles: Object-oriented programming principles like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism are applied both in entity relationships and feature implementation.
